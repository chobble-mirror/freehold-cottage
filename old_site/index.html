-- Residents must have access to privacy, security and confidentiality.
<br>
-- First consideration is given to respecting residents' wishes and needs.
<br>
-- Individual care and support, with regular reviews and updates, is genuinely negotiated with each resident. 
<br>
-- Residents' views are taken into account in determining the operational development of the home. 
<br>
